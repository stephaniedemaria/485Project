# 485Project


For our project, we analyzed Trump's tweets using python. This included using Twitter's API to create a sentiment analysis of tweets, creating charts, and generating a wordcloud all focusing on Trump. This project showcases the trending issue of people in positions of power using social media platforms such as Twitter very openly and without any limitations.

The results of our project include a sentiment analysis using Twitter API, graphs, and wordclouds to illustrate Trump's tweets. The video that we posted to Flipgrid explains these features in more detail. To follow along with our code, you will need to satisfy the requirements that are outlined on our repository's requirements.txt file. This txt file lists all the additional items that need to be downloaded to follow along with our project. 

The results of our sentiment analysis are showcased on our website and Flipgrid video. We gather the percentage of positive and negative tweets by analyzing recent tweets with the key word “Donald Trump” and determine whether it is good/bad based on our criteria given. The query and sample size can be changed to any example desired. 

Two graphs are provided on our page. Graph.py is a simple bar graph pulling data from our trumpwords.csv file. This included specified words and the amount Trump used them on Twitter since his presidency began. The groupedgraph.py is a better visual graph with a comparison of tweets using his all-time Twitter data and his tweets from presidency. 

Our word cloud displays the most frequently used words based on our archive.csv file. This file contains all of Trump’s tweets since he began presidency. We included an extra list of stop words to eliminate irrelevant words from the display. The words noted as his most frequent words were more positive, showing that since Presidency, he has been a bit more conservative with the way he tweets. 

For some fun, we also added maskedcloud.py which is essentially the same wordcloud as our original, but with a nice mask of Trump’s face. A few tweaks and the mask added, it gives a more defined visual of our project.
